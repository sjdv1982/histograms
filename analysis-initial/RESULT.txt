NOTE: based on a flawed rescoring!

218 cases

ATTRACT: 81 successes 
  in the top 500k (50 % of all natives OR at least 1000)
paste ATTRACT-5A-top500k.txt  natives-5A.txt | awk 'NR > 1 && $1 >= 1000 || $1/$2 >= 0.5'  | wc -l

Columns to select (counting from zero) from histo-5A-top50k.txt:
[165,  25, 150, 166,  43,  80,  62, 172,  64, 184]
Number of successes: 74
Probably better than ATTRACT, since natives could be accumulated by different columns
